# 📰 Fake News Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using multiple machine learning models and a full end-to-end pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise of online misinformation, it's crucial to develop tools that can help detect fake news before it spreads. This repository provides a system that preprocesses text data, trains and tunes multiple models (Passive-Aggressive, SVM, XGBoost), evaluates them, and offers a user interface to make predictions interactively.

## 📦 Setup & Installation

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd fake-news-detection

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
| Model              | Accuracy / F1 (fill in) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Passive-Aggressive | 99%      |
| SVM                | 99%      |
| XGBoost            | 99%      |

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

Integrate advanced deep learning models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)
Build a Streamlit/FastAPI web interface
Expand to multi-language detection
Deploy on cloud for real-time usage
