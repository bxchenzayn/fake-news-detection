## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise of online misinformation, it's crucial to develop tools that can help detect fake news before it spreads. This repository provides a system that preprocesses text data, trains and tunes multiple models (Passive-Aggressive, SVM, XGBoost), evaluates them, and offers a user interface to make predictions interactively.
